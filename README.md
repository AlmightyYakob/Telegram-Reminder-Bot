# Telegram Reminder Bot

This is a bot for telegram that will remind users of things, by forwarding messages back to user after the specified time.

**How to use:**
- Mention the bot in a public chat, by replying to a message and typing <keyword> <wait-time>. The bot must be invoked by a keyword if it's in a public chat or it will not respond
- Forward a message directly to the bot, adding in the text field how long to wait.
  
Keywords that can invoke the bot are: @OGRemindMeBot, !remindme (Capitilization doesn't matter)

Wait times can be of the format <number> <seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years>
